              The accuracy of the image captioning model described in the code
              cannot be directly measured using traditional accuracy metrics
              like precision, recall, or classification accuracy, as it's not a
              classification task. Instead, the quality of the generated
              captions can be evaluated using metrics like BLEU score, which
              measures the similarity between the generated captions and
              human-generated reference captions.

              The project offered hands-on experience in implementing deep
              learning models for image captioning, highlighting the importance
              of data preprocessing and tokenization. Evaluation metrics such as
              BLEU score were utilized to assess model performance, providing
              insights into model accuracy and suitability for real-world
              applications. Integrating the model with web frameworks like Flask
              showcased the practical deployment of machine learning solutions,
              facilitating interactive applications. Overall, the project
              fostered a deeper understanding of image captioning systems, data
              handling, evaluation techniques, and deployment strategies.
